            <p>im a highschool student who likes making silly websites, watchin animes, and playing computer games. this website was made while on a trip and is a place to put things ive worked on or want to work on. i am a big fan of miku and her songs, my favorite song right now is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxwOxFt5d4">hito mania</a> which is not a miku song but close enough. i want to learn how to draw in a manga style, i really like the art styles in oniichan wa oshimai and non non biyori. i really like dense cities with public transportation, trains, and small towns in the country.</p>

            <img src="assets/giri.png" alt="onigiri" id="giri">

            <p>i am currently practicing archery (olympic recurve) but also want to get into rock climbing. i used to do it but stopped for no particular reason, its fun and seems healthy. i also like cooking though im not very good but want to get better. recently i have made frided rice and vegetable tempuras. my favorite foods are onigiri and karaage.</p>



            <p>my favorite games are celeste, hollow knight, omori, and undertale, but i mostly play minecraft now. a really good celeste map is <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/440509">celestial column</a>. ive also played through doki doki literature club and katawa shoujo which are both very good visual novels that more people should play through. especially katawa shoujo :3</p>
